## 40.5.0 - August 10, 2017

### Bug Fixes
    
#### salesforcedx-vscode-apex

* Fixed the way entries are stored in the database to prevent errors when upgrading to the latest version of the extension ([PR #42](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/pull/42), [PR #43](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/pull/43)).

#### salesforcedx-vscode-core

* The command SFDX: Create a Default Scratch Org now looks for `*-scratch-def.json` files only in the `config` directory and its children ([PR #41](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/pull/41)).
* SFDX commands appear in the command palette only when a directory open in a VS Code window contains an `sfdx-project.json` file ([PR #40](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/pull/40#issuecomment-320560173)).
